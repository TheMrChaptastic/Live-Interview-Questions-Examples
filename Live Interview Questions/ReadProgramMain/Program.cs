            // This is Practice for Possible Live Coding Sections during Interviews! Practice on your own or with someone to give you the prompts and be able to explain your ideas for a solution before coding!
            // Practice with 3-5 Questions starting with Stage 1 questions then moving into some Stage 2 questions and a few interviews moved into some Stage 3 questions. 
            // Try not to look up these questions online to better test your knowledge and get used to the interview scenario of anything could be shown to you. 
            // When solving these questions communication is important. Try to Say Aloud your idea for a solution, then code your idea. 
            // For this practice looking up correct way to write syntax is fine since you will be able to ask your interviewers to clarify Syntax you might not remember exact wording for. 

            // If you arent following the prompts try looking at the Live Interview Questions Tests Files to see the test cases and expected return values for each test!
